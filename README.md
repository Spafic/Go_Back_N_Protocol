# üåê Network Transmission Protocol Simulation

## üöÄ Go-Back-N Protocol Transmission Simulator

---

### üìã Overview
This Python script simulates a network transmission protocol using the Go-Back-N technique, demonstrating frame transmission, error handling, and wire efficiency calculation.

### ‚ú® Features
- Simulates network frame transmission with potential frame failures
- Implements Go-Back-N protocol
- Calculates wire efficiency
- Provides detailed transmission statistics
- Converts messages to binary representation
- Handles dynamic window sizes

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `random` module (standard library)

#### Clone Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Spafic/Go_Back_N_Protocol.git
cd Go_Back_N_Protocol
```

#### Install Dependencies
No additional dependencies are required as the script uses Python's standard library.

#### Run the Simulator
```sh
python main.py
```

#### User Inputs
1. Message to transmit
2. Window size for transmission

> [!NOTE]
> **Example Workflow**
> 
> ```sh
> Enter message: Hello
> Enter window size: 3
> ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Protocol Mechanics
- Dynamically sends frames based on window size
- Randomly simulates frame transmission success/failure
- Supports automatic retransmission of failed frames using Go-Back-N strategy
- Tracks and reports transmission efficiency

---

### üìà Output Details
- Received message
- Binary representation
- Total frames sent
- Failed frames
- Wire efficiency percentage

---

### üß© Simulation Characteristics
- Random frame transmission success
- Go-Back-N frame management
- Adaptive retransmission strategy
